Program Header Table
---------------------
At the highest level, an ELF executable is roughly a container for machine code.

To execute a piece of machine code, the code must be loaded into the memory.

This is the job of the so-called "program header" in ELF 

Program headers, also known as the program segment headers, provide information about how the segments of the executable file should be loaded into memory during the programâ€™s execution.

The program header table stores information about segments

	Describe the location and size of the segments

	Contains information needed by the OS to load the segments into process memory

	Located after ELF Header

	One header exists after each segment

	Size of program header is fixed

Segments
-----------

Segments break down the structure of an ELF binary into suitable chunks to prepare the executable to be loaded into memory. 

	Each segment is mapped to multiple sections

	Not all sections will be mapped to a segment

	Not all sections will get loaded into memory

An ELF file consists segments which describe how to create a process/memory image for runtime execution.



Command to view segments
-------------------------

$ readelf -l <elf_file>

$ reaelf --segments <elf_file>

$ readelf --wide --segments <elf_file>

$ readelf -a <elf_file>

$ hd -n 56 -s 64 /bin/ls
