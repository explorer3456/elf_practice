ELF
---------

ELF Stands for Executable and Linkable Format

It's a format for 
	Binaries
		These are the files which are the output of the linker and can be used by exec program to create a memory image for the process
	Libraries
		These are the .so files which are used by dynamic linkers at runtime to form a runnable process
	Core dumps:
		Core dumps are created when a program terminated with a fault
	Object Code: 
		These are the files which end up with .o extension and are primarily a target of the Linker Program to be linked into the executable
	Kernel Module

This file is loaded by kernel to create a process

ELF format is versatile, its design allows it to be executed on various processor types

It supports
	Big Endian and Little Endain
	32-Bit and 64-bit Architecture Systems

It also supports features such as dynamic linking
	which allows shared libraries to be loaded and linked at runtime
	position-independent code, which enables executables and libraries to be loaded at different memory addresses

Specification does not clarify the filename extension for ELF files.
In use is a variety of letter combinations, such as .axf, .bin, .elf, .o, .prx, .puff, .ko, .so, and .mod, or none.

What about other OS?
-----------------------
However on macOS the de-facto format is Mach-O instead.
On Windows, .exe files uses the Portable Executable format
