ELF Header
-------------

Every ELF file has an ELF header.

It has the very important job of conveying basic information about the binary such as:

	-> What processor's it's designed to run on. ELF Files can contain machine code for different processor types like ARM and X86

	-> Whether binary is meant to be run on its own as an executable, or whether it's meant to be loaded by other programs as a "dynamically linked library"

	-> The entry point of the executable. The entry point is a memory address pointing to where the first machine code instructions is in memory after the entire process has been loaded

The ELF header is always at the start of the file. 

It specifies the locations of the program header table and section header, which can be anywhere within the file.

Those tables, in turn, point to data stored elsewhere in the file.



How to view the ELF Header
----------------------------

The binutils provides a program called readelf which gives more detailed information about elf file

readelf using the -h (header) option to dump the files' ELF header on your screen. 

$ readelf -h /bin/ls

$ ldd /bin/ls

$ readelf -h /lib64/libc.so.6

$ readelf -h userspace.o

$ readelf -h userspace

$ hexdump -C userspace | head -n 1

$ hd -n 64 userspace

$ file userspace

$ xxd -l4 <elf file>
