Structure of ELF File
----------------------
ELF file is divided into mainly four parts:

	ELF header
	Section header and different sections
	Program header/segment and different segments
	Object code

Each of these elements play a different role in the linking/loading process of ELF executable

Particularly, the ELF header is always available in the ELF file, while the Section header table is important during link time to create an executable.

On the other hand, the Program header table is useful during runtime to help load the executable into memory.
