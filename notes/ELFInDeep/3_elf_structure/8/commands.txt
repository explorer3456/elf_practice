gdb
-------
The ‘start’ command does the equivalent of setting a temporary breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking the ‘run’ command.

The ‘starti’ command does the equivalent of setting a temporary breakpoint at the first instruction of a program’s execution and then invoking the ‘run’ command.

Other option
The info files prints information about debugging targets and memory spaces occupied by different sections

(gdb) info files
    ...
    Entry point: 0x80000000
    ...
(gdb) break *0x80000000
(gdb) run


set backtrace past-main on
---------------------------

Normally the caller of "main" is not of interest, so GDB will terminate the backtrace at "main"

Set this variable if you need to see the rest of the stack trace.
