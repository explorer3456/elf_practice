Dumping compiler ABI Info
----------------------------

Every MCU Architecture has an Application Binary Interface (ABI).

An ABI details things such as which registers to use for passing arguments and which ones must be preserved across function calls.

Sometimes, a given architecture may have several ABI configuration options which can be selected via compiler flags. 

For example or ARMV7-m, there are two different ABIs which can be used for passing floating point arguments as parameters.

One which passes arguments in "VFP" registers and one which uses general purpose register.

We can discover which options are used along with some other information by using readelf's -A argument

$ arm-none-eabi-readelf -A <elf_file>
