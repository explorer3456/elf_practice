sstrip
---------

sstrip is a small utility that removes as much as possible from an ELF file without affecting the file's memory image.

Most ELF executables are built with both a program header table and a section header table. 

However, only the former is required in order for the OS to load, link and execute a program.

sstrip attempts to extract the ELF header, the program header table, and its contents, leaving everything else in the bit bucket.

It should be noted that most programs that work with ELF files are dependent on the section header table as an index to the file's contents.

Thus, utilities such as gdb and objdump will often have limited functionality when working with an executable with no section header table. Some other utilities may refuse to work with them at all.
