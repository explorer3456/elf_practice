ELF Sections
---------------
The code and data in an ELF binary are logically divided into contiguous non-overlapping chunks called sections.

The division into sections is intended to provide a convenient organization for use by the linker

When a program is compiled, different things are generated after compilation.

         all binary executable code goes into the .text section,

         all initialised variables are grouped in the .data section,

         all uninitialised variables are grouped in the .bss section

         all constant strings are grouped in .rodata section

         all variable and function names go in .symtab (which is called the symbol table) and

         all debug information is grouped in the .debug section.

All this information is put in the section part of the ELF file.

Command to view sections
---------------------------

$ readelf -S userspace

$ readelf -WS userspace

First entry (0th index) always stores NULL, i.e. zeroed out for historical reasons

$ readelf -x .code userspace.o

$ readelf -x .data userspace.o

$ readelf -x .rodata userspace.o

$ readelf -x .bss userspace.o
