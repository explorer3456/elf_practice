Note Sections
---------------

In ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries, note sections are special sections that contain arbitrary information or metadata.

Note sections can be used by various tools, compilers, and utilities to embed additional information into the binary. 

 This information can serve various purposes, such as 
	specifying the compiler version used to build the binary, 
	indicating specific features or attributes, 
	providing debugging information, or 
	conveying other relevant data.

.note.gnu.build-id: 
	This note section contains a globally unique identifier (GUID), also known as a build ID, which uniquely identifies the build of the binary. 
	This can be useful for distinguishing between different builds of the same binary and for ensuring consistency in build environments.

.note.gnu.property: 
	This note section contains various properties or attributes associated with the binary

.note.ABI-tag: 
	This note section contains information about the ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility of the binary. 
	It specifies the ABI version and any specific requirements or features related to the ABI.
