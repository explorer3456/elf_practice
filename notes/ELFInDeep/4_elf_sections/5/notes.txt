Debugging sections
-------------------
Compile option with -g and check how many new sections are added


DWARF is a standardized format for representing debug information (i.e., symbol names, struct layouts, how to recover backtraces etc).

DWARF is an acronym for "Debugging With Arbitrary Record Formats"

When a program is compiled with debug information (with the -g flag), this information will be written into special .debug_ ELF sections
