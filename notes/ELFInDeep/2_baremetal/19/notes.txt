Example of Data in RAM
-----------------------

Let's try to attempt to write a program and place the .data section in RAM

Add program is modified to load two values from RAM, add them and store the result back to RAM.

The two values and the space for result is placed in the .data section.


$ arm-none-eabi-as -o add-mem.o add-mem.s
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -T add-ld.lds -o add-mem.elf add-mem.o
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n add-mem.elf
