Using RAM
===========

The flash memory, in which the previous example program were stored is a kind of EEPROM.

It is a useful secondary storage, like a hard disk, but is not convenient to store variables in Flash.

The variables should be stored in RAM, so that they can be easily modified.

The connex board has a 64MB of RAM starting at address 0xA000 0000 in which variables can be stored.

Necessary setup has to be done to place the variables at this address.

To understand what has to be done, the role of assembler and linker has to be understood
