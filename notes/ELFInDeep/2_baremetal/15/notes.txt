Section Merging
------------------

When dealing with multi-file programs, the sections with the same name (example .text) might appear in each file.

The linker is responsible for merging sections from the input files into sections of the output file.

By default, the sections with the same name, from each file is placed contiguously and the label references are patched to reflect the new values.

The effects of section merging can be seen by looking at the symbol table of the object files and the corresponding executable file. 

 The multi-file sum of array program can be used to illustrate section merging. 

$ arm-none-eabi-nm main.o

$ arm-none-eabi-nm sum-sub.o

$ arm-none-eabi-ld -Ttext=0x0 -o sum.elf main.o sum-sub.o

$ arm-none-eabi-nm sum.elf

The loop symbol has address 0x4 in sum-sub.o, and 0x28 in sum.elf, since the .text section of sum-sub.o is placed right after the .text section of main.o.
