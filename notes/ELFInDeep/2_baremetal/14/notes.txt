Relocation
-------------

Relocation is the process of changing addresses already assigned to labels. 

This will aslo involve patching up all label references to relect the newly assigned address.

Primarily relocation is performed for the following two reasons:

	1. Section Merging
	2. Section Placement

To understand the process of relocation, an understanding of the concept of sections is essential.

For example, code can be placed in read-only memory, and data might required read-write memory

It would be convenient, if code and data is not mixed.

For this purpose, programs are divided into sections.

Most programs have at least two sections:

	.text for code
	.data for data

 Assembler directives .text and .data, are used to switch back and forth between the two sections.

It helps to imagine each section as a bucket. 

When the assembler hits a section directive, it puts the code/data following the directive in the selected bucket

Thus the code/data that belong to particular section appear in contiguous locations.
