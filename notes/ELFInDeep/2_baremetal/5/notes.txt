Assembly Introduction
------------------------

The assembly program source file consists of a sequence of statements, one per line

Each statement has the following format.

label:    instruction         @ comment

Each of the components is optional.

label:

	Label is a convenient way to refer to the location of the instruction in memory
	Label can be used where ever an address can appear, for example as an operand of the branch instruction
	Label name should consist of alphabets, digits, _ and $

comment:
	A comment starts with an @, and the characters that appear after an @ are ignored

instruction:

	The instruction could be an ARM instruction or an assembler directive.
	Assembler directives are commands to the assembler.
	Assembler directives always start with a . (period).

Eg. 

	stop:	b stop               @ Infinite loop to stop execution
