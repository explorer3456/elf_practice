Opcodes/Machine Code
--------------------

An opcode (abbreviated from operation code) also known as instruction machine code is a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be peformed.

An instruction tells the processor what operation needs to be performed.

Each instruction is made up of an opcode (operation code) and operand(s).

An instruction set is a list of the opcodes available for the processor.

Output of assembly code and other programming languages will be finally machine code.

Machine Codes
---------------

a) Using a number of switches. This generates a sequence of 1 and 0. This was used in the early days of computing. Since the 1970s, it is no longer used.

b) Using a Hex editor. This allows the use of opcodes instead of the number of the command.

c) Using an Assembler. Assembly languages are simpler than opcodes. Their syntax is easier to understand than machine language but harder than high level languages. The assembler will translate the source code into machine code on its own.

d) Using a High-level programming language allows programs that use code that is easier to read and write. These programs are translated into machine code. The translation can happen in many steps.
