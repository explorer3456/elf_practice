Global Variables
================

When C code is compiled, the compiler places initialized global variables in the .data section

So just as with the assembly, the .data has to be copied from Flash to RAM.

The C language guarantees that all uninitialized global variables will be initialized to zero. 

When C programs are compiled, a separate section called .bss is used for uninitialized variables. 

Since the value of these variables are all zeroes to start with, they do not have to be stored in Flash. 

Before transferring control to C code, the memory locations corresponding to these variables have to be initialized to zero.

Read-only Data
===============

GCC places global variables marked as const in a separate section, called .rodata.

The .rodata is also used for storing string constants.

Since contents of .rodata section will not be modified, they can be placed in Flash. The linker script has to modified to accomodate this.
