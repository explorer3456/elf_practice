Generating binary file
---------------------------

The output file created by ld is in a format called ELF

Various file formats are available for storing executable code.

The ELF format works fine when you have an OS around

Since we are going to run the program on bare metal, we will have to convert it to a simpler file format called the binary format.

A file in binary format contains consecutive bytes from a specific memory address.

A file in binary format contains consecutive bytes from a specific memory address.

The GNU toolchainâ€™s objcopy command can be used to convert between different object file formats

A common usage of the command is given below.

$ objcopy -O <output-format> <in-file> <out-file>

To convert add.elf to binary format the following command can be used.

$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary add.elf add.bin

Check the size of the file. The file will be exactly 16 bytes

Since there are 4 instructions and each instruction occupies 4 bytes.

$ ls -l add.bin
                                                                       
~
