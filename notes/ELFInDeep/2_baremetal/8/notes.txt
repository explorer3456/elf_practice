Verifying Registers in QEMU Monitor
------------------------------------

$ qemu-system-arm -M connex -pflash flash.bin -nographic -serial /dev/null

The system executes the instructions and after completion, keeps looping infinitely in the stop: b stop instruction.

To view the contents of the registers, the monitor interface of qemu can be used

The monitor interface is a command line interface, through which the emulated system can be controlled and the status of the system can be viewed.

To view the contents of the registers the info registers monitor command can be used.

(qemu) info registers

Note the value in register R02. The register contains the result of the addition and should match with the expected value of 9.

More Monitor Commands
-------------------------


help   List available commands

quit   Quits the emulator

xp /fmt addr Physical memory dump from addr

system_reset Reset the system.

This xp command with the i format, can be used to disassemble the instructions present in memory.

Syntax of fmt: <count><format><size>

count: specifies number of data items to be dumped
format: specifies display format. x -> hex, d->signed decimal, u -> unsigned decimal, o -> octal, c->char, i -> asm instructions
size : specifies the size of each data item. b -> 8 bits, h->16 bits, w -> 32 bits, g->64 bits

 
To disassemble the instructions located at 0x0, the xp command with the fmt specified as 4iw can be used.

The 4 specifies 4 items are to be displayed, i specifies that the items are to be printed as instructions (yes, a built in disassembler!), w specifies that the items are 32 bits in size.
