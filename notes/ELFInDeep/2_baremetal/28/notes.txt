Startup Code
===============

Linker script has to be updated for the following:

	a. .bss section placement
	b. vectors section placement
	c. .rodata section placement

The .bss is placed right after .data section in RAM. 

 Symbols to locate the start of .bss and end of .bss are also created in the linker script.

The .rodata is placed right after .text section in Flash.
