Linker modifications for data section
---------------------------------------

RAM is volatile memory, and hence it is not possible to directly make the data available in RAM , on power up

All code and data should be stored in Flash before power-up. 

On power-up, a startup code is supposed to copy the data from Flash to RAM, and then proceed with the execution of the program

So the programâ€™s .data section has two addresses, a load address in Flash and a run-time address in RAM.

In ld parlance, the load address is called LMA (Load Memory Address), and the run-time address is called VMA (Virtual Memory Address.).

The following two modifications have to be done, to make the program work correctly.

1. The linker script has to be modified to specify both the load address and the run-time address, for the .data section.

2. A small piece of code should copy the .data section from Flash (load address) to RAM (run-time address).
