Linker
----------

When writing a multi-file program, each file is assembled individually into object files.

The linker combines these object files to form the final executable.


a.s --> Assembler --> a.o
b.s --> Assembler --> b.o
c.s --> Assembler --> c.o

a.o
b.o --->Linker  --> abc
c.o

When combining the object files together, the linker performs the following operations.

1. Symbol Resolution
2. Relocation
