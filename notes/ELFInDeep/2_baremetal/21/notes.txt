Specifying Load Address
==========================

The run-time address is what that should be used for determining the address of labels.

In the previous linker script, we have specified the run-time address for the .data section

The load address is not explicitly specified, and defaults to the run-time address. 

This is OK, with the previous examples, since the programs were executed directly from Flash

But, if data is to be placed in RAM during execution, the load address should correspond to Flash and the run-time address should correspond to RAM.

A load address different from the run-time address can be specified using the AT keyword. The modified linker script is shown below.


SECTIONS {
        . = 0x00000000;
        .text : { * (.text); }
        etext = .; ❶

        . = 0xA0000000;
        .data : AT (etext) { * (.data); } ❷
}

❶  Symbols can be created on the fly within the SECTIONS command by assigning values to them.
   Here etext is assigned the value of the location counter at that position. 
   etext contains the address of the next free location in Flash right after all the code.
   Note that etext itself will not be allocated any memory, it is just an entry in the symbol table.

❷  The AT keyword specifies the load address of the .data section
   An address or symbol (whose value is a valid address) could be passed as argument to AT.
    Here the load address of .data is specified as the location right after all the code in Flash.
