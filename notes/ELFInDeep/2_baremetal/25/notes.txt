C Startup
================

It is not possible to directly execute C code, when the processor comes out of reset.

Since, unlike assembly language, C Programs need some basic pre-requisites to be satisfied.

Let's take an example of sum of array in C:

static int arr[] = { 1, 10, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
static int sum;
static const int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

int main()
{
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
                sum += arr[i];
}

Before transferring control to C code, the following have to be setup correctly

1. Stack
2. Global Variables	
	a. Initialized
	b. Uninitialized
3. Read-only Data
