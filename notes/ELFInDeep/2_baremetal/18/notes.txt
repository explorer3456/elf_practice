Linker Script Example
===========================

To demonstrate the use of linker script, we will use a slightly modified version of the sum of array program for this purpose.

The only change here is that the array is now in the .data section

Also note that the nasty branch instruction to skip over the data is also not required, since the linker script will place the .text section and .data section appropriately

$ arm-none-eabi-as -o sum-data.o sum-data.s
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -T sum-data.lds -o sum-data.elf sum-data.o

The option -T sum-data.lds specifies that sum-data.lds is to be used as the linker script.

 Dumping the symbol table, will provide an insight into how the sections are placed in memory.


$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n sum-data.elf

From the symbol table it is obvious that the .text is placed starting from address 0x0 and .data section is placed starting from address 0x400.
